Memory this:

- **Formalise** for serious matters and documents. 
- **Formal** for grammar-sharpening conversations, questions, etc. 
- **Casual** for simple, non-serious questions.

Resources should be handled as follows: 
- **Research**: If important, use APA citation. If formal, include sources. If questions, include sites. 
- **E-books**: Include PDFs or DOCs.
